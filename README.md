Reflection:
This was a 1 month long project built during my Web Development course (ITP 104)
at the University of Southern California. Project goals included implementing concepts 
taught in class (i.e. divs, href links, CSS styling, jQuery plugins, etc) to create a 
presentable and functional website. 

During this project, I ran into styling difficulties, especially with the header images. 
I originally used CSS "background-image" which inhibited my ability to adjust the images' 
position. Upon reviewing course content, I alternatively used <img> tags in my HTML code and 
CSS "position" to rearrange image positions, providing greater flexibility and ease when I later
implemented jQuery plugins. 

Some limitations I would like to address and improve on is the project's optimization for
laptop screensizes. By incorporating @media-query and additional CSS code, this website has the 
potential to be viewed across all screen sizes. 

In summary, this project implements HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (plugins).
